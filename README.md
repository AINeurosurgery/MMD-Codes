# Novel method of calculation of MRI perfusion and comparison of single versus double barrel STA-MCA bypass for revascularisation in Moya Moya disease

This is the official implementation of the GUI's for the calculation of Perfusion values and Vessel density. We have implemented the codes in Python with the following specifications.

## Python Environment Requirements:

* Python 3.9.7+
* PIL 8.4.0
* os 
* numpy 1.20.3
* tkinter
* copy
* cv2 4.5.5

## Proceduere to run the codes

* Create a python environment with the abovementioned specifications
* Run the code, perfusion_estimator.py using the command python perfusion_estimator.py to start the GUI for perfusion estimation. Follow the instructions present in the GUI and calculate the perfusion values.
* Run the code, Vessel_density_estimator.py using the command python Vessel_density_estimator.py to start the GUI for perfusion estimation. Follow the instructions present in the GUI and calculate the the vessel density.
